# Evojam - Awesome Lists

## Idea ðŸŽ“

IT (and Evojam!) community is known as the knowledge-sharing culture. It gives us a bunch of resources to learn new things. But how to pick the right ones? Thatâ€™s the moment when awesome lists come to the scene. When we learn new skills, we use vary of articles, books and videos - subconsciously we track the route. By systematizing and gathering those materials we create roadmaps. Letâ€™s imagine now, how we could speed up growing of each other when we could use someone elseâ€™s maps instead of digging through google results! Letâ€™s do the roadmaps for a better tomorrow! ;)
